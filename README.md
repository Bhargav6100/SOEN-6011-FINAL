A Swing-based Java application that calculates the tangent of a given angle in degrees.
The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) for user input, result display, and computation time.

Key Features:
Calculate the tangent of an angle in degrees.
Displays computation time for the calculation.
User-friendly GUI with input and output areas.
Handles exceptions for invalid inputs.

Installation:
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or newer installed on your machine.
